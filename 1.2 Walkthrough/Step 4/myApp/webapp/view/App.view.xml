<!--The root node of the XML structure is the view.
Here, we reference the default namespace sap.m where the majority of our UI assets are located.
We define an additional sap.ui.core.mvc namespace with alias mvc,
where the SAPUI5 views and all other Model-View-Controller (MVC) assets are located.-->
<!--Inside the view tag, we add the declarative definition of our text control with the same properties as in the previous step.
The XML tags are mapped to controls and the attributes are mapped to the properties of the control.-->
